==================================================
Model                | Loss (Lower is Better)    | RMSE (Lower is Better)   
--------------------------------------------------
3-Factor Model       | 29986.1406                | 1.3678                   
1-Factor Model       | 30939.8594                | 1.3798                   
BPS Model (w/ Prior) | 33461.5759                | 1.3635                   
==================================================

Note: Loss for 3/1-Factor models is NegLogLikelihood. Loss for BPS is ELBO.
      These loss types are not directly comparable. RMSE is a directly comparable metric.
