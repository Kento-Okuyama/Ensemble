--- 1. Loading Data and Pre-trained Baseline Models ---
Defined true transition parameters locally.
All necessary files loaded successfully.

--- 2. Defining Regime-Switching Kalman Filter (FRS) Model ---

--- 3. Training FRS Model ---
    -> Initializing state-space params IDENTICALLY to VAR model (True value + noise)...
    -> Aligning transition param initial values by SAMPLING from BPS priors.

Early stopping triggered.
FRS model training finished. Duration: 107.49s
FRS model results saved to 'results_IMPLEMENT_2.0\frs_model_results_IMPLEMENT 2.0.pt'.

--- 4. Evaluating Final FRS Model ---
    -> Initializing state-space params IDENTICALLY to VAR model (True value + noise)...
    -> Aligning transition param initial values by SAMPLING from BPS priors.
