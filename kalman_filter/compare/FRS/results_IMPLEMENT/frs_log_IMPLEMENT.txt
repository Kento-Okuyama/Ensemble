All output files will be saved to the 'results_IMPLEMENT/' directory.

--- 1. Loading Data and Pre-trained Baseline Models ---
Defined true transition parameters locally.
All necessary files loaded successfully.

--- 2. Defining Regime-Switching Kalman Filter (FRS) Model ---

--- 3. Training FRS Model ---
    -> Initializing state-space params IDENTICALLY to VAR model (True value + noise)...
    -> Aligning transition param initial values by SAMPLING from BPS priors.

Early stopping triggered.
FRS model training finished. Duration: 81.06s
FRS model results saved to 'results_IMPLEMENT\frs_model_results_IMPLEMENT.pt'.

--- 4. Evaluating Final FRS Model ---
    -> Initializing state-space params IDENTICALLY to VAR model (True value + noise)...
    -> Aligning transition param initial values by SAMPLING from BPS priors.
