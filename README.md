# Ensemble

### M-complete problem
 - DGP: AR1 & MA1 & WN
 - Fitted models: AR1 & MA1 

20241203: single time series
20241205: single time series, influence of within-latent variables on the transition probability was made bigger
20241209: extended to multi-persons, intercept for staying probability was made smaller to facilitate more frequent transitions

### M-open problem
 - DGP: ARMA(2,3) & MA(2) & WN
 - Fitted models: AR1 & MA1 

20241211: target_mean is differentiated, the DGP is designed for an M-open problem
